                <p>As a Personal Trainer I am here to help you reach your personal health and fitness goals.
                    I have always been passionate about the fitness/sports industry. My goal is not to inspire you,
                    because I believe that inspiration comes from within, but I want to motivate you and encourage
            you towards a more positive, healthy and active lifestyle through physical fitness.</p>
                <p> "Once you start seeing results, it becomes an addiction"</p>
                <p> I just need you to keep pushing and "Be stronger than your strongest excuse"</p>
